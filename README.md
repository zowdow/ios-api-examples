# Zowdow Autosuggest Service

Â© 2015-2017 Zowdow, Inc.

The Zowdow Autosuggest service is intended to provide application developers with a new opportunity to monetize in the search autosuggest space.

We offer a robust, micro-SDK for iOS that is currently deployed across many distribution partners.

We also offer access through a direct API as documented in the example here.

The application developer will require an app-id key in order to integrated and test. You can request an app-id key by sending an email to dev@zowdow.com.
